# Ulyzses Discord Bot

What am I? I have no idea. I made this bot for fun so commands may be useless or useful only to me.

# Commands

## Syntax

 - All commands are prefixed by `>`
 - Optional arguments are enclosed in `()`

## Implemented Commands

`>gif (keyword)` - Sends a random GIF based on the keyword given. If the keyword is ommitted or is `random`, sends a random GIF instead.

`>help (command)` - Gives information and usage about a specific command. Lists all commands instead if no arguments are given.
